# CriminalIntent Android APP

Android-based mobile app done as a part of Big Nerd Ranch Guide series.

It lets you create a series of "criminal activities" happened at your workspace by taking notes (where you describe an incident), choose a suspect, choose a date of an incident and taking photos to support your case. If you feel that you've collected enough evidence you can send a message to people in your "Contacts" app

Concepts introduced and implemented:
1) Fragments, Fragments Lifecycle and Fragments Arguments
2) Communication between Fragments using Intents and Fragment Arguments
3) RecyclerView and its implementation
4) ConstraintLayout
5) View Pager and its implementation
6) Android Dialogs (implementation done in a form of a calendar dialog)
7) Toolbars and its implementation

   for information retrieval)
10) Taking photos using implicit intent and saving it
11) Two-pane interface for tablets. Implementation is done by providing a default alias resource value and then selecting a right layout
    based on the density independent pixels or dp)
